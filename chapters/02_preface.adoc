= Preface

`mod_rewrite` is one of the most powerful modules that comes with the
Apache http server. It's also one of the most frequently misused, and
least understood.

This book is a humble attempt to disperse some of the mystery
surrounding `mod_rewrite` and make its power accessible to all users of
the Apache web server.

It will also cover many of the cases in which you should not use
`mod_rewrite`, and what you should use instead in those situations.

The first incarnation of this book, 
*The Definitive Guide to Apache mod_rewrite* - <http://drbacchus.com/book/rewrite>,
was published in 2006.

Since then, so much has changed that while that book is still useful,
it's far from complete.

In February of 2012, Apache httpd version 2.4 was released, with a huge
number of enhancements and changes. Many of the things that people have
been using `mod_rewrite` for now have better solutions. Meanwhile,
`mod_rewrite` itself improved quite a bit, too, and can do many new
things.

This book still focuses primarily on `mod_rewrite`, but will touch on
many of the surrounding topics and modules.

This book does **not** attempt to be a comprehensive book about the
Apache web server. For that, I encourage you to look the documentation -
<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current> - and also at my other book,
Apache Cookbook, Third Edition, which should be available around the
same time that this book is published.

That said, the scope of this book has expanded (since the earlier
incarnation) to include not merely URL
rewriting, but also methods for munging (modifying) content, and
dynamic conditional configuration. In many cases, these techniques make
mod_rewrite unnecessary, or, at least, provide easier alternatives, so
they fit the scope of the book very well.

These techniques include mod_substitute, mod_proxy_html, the ``Define``
directive, the ``<If>`` container, mod_macro, and many more. Along the
way, we'll also discuss the various parts of URL mapping, the
understanding of which allows you to avoid using these more complicated
techniques.

While all of these are covered in the formal documentation
<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current>, this book offers a companion
to hold your hand and offer you more in depth assistance in your journey
towards Apache httpd mastery.

== About This Book

This book is written in Asciidoc, processed into various other formats
using Asciidoctor. Previous incarnations were written in LaTeX,
ReStructuredText, Markdown, and who knows what else. There always seems
to be a new book format out there. It's exhausting.

You can always obtain the most recent version of
the book at ``http://mod-rewrite.org/``, and you'll usually be able to buy a 
fairly recent version in the Amazon Kindle store. Some day, there will 
hopefully be a printed version, too.

If you'd like to get involved in the creation of this book, or if you'd like to 
tell me about something that needs fixed, Go to GitHub -
<https://github.com/rbowen/modrewrite_book> - and either submit pull requests
or open a ticket. If you don't know what that means, you are welcome to 
submit errata to ``rbowen@rcbowen.com``, and some day there will be a handy
way to do this on the website. Not today.

This book is a work in progress. If you purchased the book in electronic
form, you should be eligible to receive updates from wherever you bought
it. If you're not, send me your email receipt (rbowen@rcbowen.com), 
and I'll send you an updated version.

A brief word about the documentation. The official docs, at <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current>,
are great, and are the work of many dedicated people. I'm one of many. This book is 
intended to augment those docs, and not replace them. If it appears sometimes that 
I have copied shamelessly from the documentation, I humbly ask you to remember that 
I participated in writing those docs, and the edits flowed both directions -- that 
is, sometimes it was the docs that shamelessly copied from the book.

== About the Author

Rich Bowen has been involved on the Apache http server documentation
since about 1998. He is also the author of **Apache Cookbook**, and **The
Definitive Guide to Apache mod_rewrite**. You can frequently find him in
#httpd, on ``irc.freenode.net``. under the name of DrBacchus or rbowen.

Rich works at Red Hat, in the OSAS (Open Source and Standards) group,
where he works with the OpenStack community. See
<http://openstack.redhat.com/> for details.

He lives in Lexington, Kentucky, with his wife and kids. If you want a cat, drop by any time.

== Acknowledgements

Thanks to ``fajita``, and the other regulars on #httpd (on the ``irc.freenode.net`` 
network). ``fajita`` is my research assistant, and knows more than everyone else on
the channel put together. And the folks on #ahd who keep me sane. Or insane. 
Depending on how you measure. A warm hog to each of you.

None of this would be possible without mod_rewrite
itself, so a big thank you to Ralf Engelschall for creating it, and
all the many people who have worked on the code and documentation since
then.

Finally, and most importantly, thanks to my beautiful wife, and to Rhi,
Hammy, and Daisy, my multi-talented children, for being so wonderful 
in every way. What would I do without you?
