= Preface

`mod_rewrite` is one of the most powerful modules that comes with the
Apache http server. It's also one of the most frequently misused, and
least understood.

This book is a humble attempt to disperse some of the mystery
surrounding `mod_rewrite` and make its power accessible to all users of
the Apache web server.

It will also cover many of the cases in which you should not use
`mod_rewrite`, and what you should use insted in those situations.
